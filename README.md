# Bonzify

The upcoming source code will not be the original Bonzify Joel used, but rather an unfinished version of the improvements I wanted to do before sharing it. Some parts are still rushed, like the timing and killing of Bonzi, the EXE finder implementation and a lot of dumb batch files because they made it easier to work on the other parts.

Bonzify works on XP and later, but the DLL injection is only compatible with x86 (32 bit) executables at the moment, which means the Bonzification won't work properly on other architectures.

There are no plans fix or document anything, so don't submit issues (which are disabled anyway). Just use what's there and maybe improve it for yourself. Also, don't share binaries.
